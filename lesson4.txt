MANIPULATING FILES AND DIRECTORIES

Wildcards 
	Because the shell uses filename so much, it provides special characters to help you rapidly specify groups of filenames. These special characters are called wildcards. Using wildcards(also know as globbing) allows you to select filenames based on pattern of characters.

	WILDCARDS
	*				|	Any characters
	?				|	Any single characters
	[characters]	|	Any characters that is a member of the set characters
	[!characters]	|	Any characters that is not a member of the set characters
	[[:class:]]		|	Any characters that is a member of the  specified class

	Commonly used character classes
	[:alum:]	|	Any alphanumeric character
	[:alpha:]	|	Any alphabetic character
	[:digit:]	|	Any numeral
	[:lower:]	|	Any lowercase letter
	[:upper:]	|	Any uppercase letter

	Wildcards example
	*				|	All files
	*g 				|	Any file beginning with g
	b*.txt			|	Any file beginning with b followed by any characters and ending with .txt
	Data???			|	Any file beginning with Data followed by exactly tree characters
	[abc]*			|	Any file beginning with either a,b or c
	BACKUP.[0-9][0-9][0-9] |	Any file beginning with BACKUP followed by exactly tree numerals
	[[:super:]]* 	|	Any file beginning with an uppercase letter
	[![:digit:]]*	|	Any file not beginning with a numeral
	*[[:lower:]123]	|	Any file ending with a lowercase letter on the numerals 1,2 or 3.



mkdir command :

This command is used to create directories. It works like this :
	mkdir directory...

You can create multiple directoies like this :
	mkdir demo1 demo2 demo3
would create 3 directoies named demo1 demo2 demo3.

cp command :

The cp command copies files or directoies. It can be used two different ways :
	cp item1 item2
to copy the single file or directory item1 to file or directory item2 and :
	cp item... directory
to copy multiple items (either files or directories) into a directory.

	cp options

	-a, --archive						|	Copy the file and directories and all of their altributes,
										|	including ownerships and permission. Normally, copies take all the 		 |	 default altributes of the user performing the copy.
	-i, --interactive 					|	Before overwriting an existing file, prompt the user for confirmation. 										|	If this option is not specified, cp will silently overwrite files.
	-r, --recursive						|	Recursively copy directories and their contents. This option (or the -a 									|	option) is requied when copy directories.
	-u, --update						|	When copying files from one directory to another, copy only files that 										|	either don't exist or are newer than the existing corresponding files in 									 |	 the destination directory.
	-v, --verbose						|	Display informative messages as the copy performed
